# Image alt tags
Images on your webpage must use alt attributes. If an image cannot be displayed (e.g., due to broken image source, slow internet connection, etc), the alt attribute provides alternative information. Using relevant keywords and text in the alt attribute can help both users and search engines better interpret the subject of an image.

### Best practice
* Use image alt tags.
* Use descriptive filenames in target language.
* Use keywords in alt-tags in target language.
