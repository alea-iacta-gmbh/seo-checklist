# Image size
Images often represent the largest part of downloaded bytes on a webpage and occupy a considerable part of the visible area. Therefore, image optimization can often save the largest amount of bytes and achieve significant performance improvements for a website.

### Best practice
* Use small images (<200kb) that load quickly. Check this best practice in the [Google Developers Help](https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/performance/optimizing-content-efficiency/image-optimization)
