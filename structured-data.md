# Structured data
A website should use HTML microdata specifications (or structured data markups). Search engines use microdata to better understand the content of a site and create rich snippets in search results (which helps increase click-through rate to a site).

### Best practice
* View Google's guide for getting started with microdata: [How to structure data](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/guides/intro-structured-data).
* Check the [Google Search Gallery](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/guides/search-gallery) for structured data you might want to use.
