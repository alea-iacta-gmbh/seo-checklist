# Canonicalization
Canonicalization describes how a site can use slightly different URLs for the same page (e.g., if http://www.example.com and http://example.com displays the same page but do not resolve to the same URL). If this happens, search engines may be unsure about which URL is the correct one to index. 

### Best practice
* Use canonical links: [Google Webmaster Central Blog 1](https://webmasters.googleblog.com/2009/02/specify-your-canonical.html) and [2](https://support.google.com/webmasters/answer/139066?hl=en)
* Setup Google Analytics correctly: [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/9103794/canonical-url-in-analytics)
* [MOZ](https://moz.com/learn/seo/canonicalization)
* Use a canonical link tag to nominate a primary page when you have several pages with duplicate or very similar content.
